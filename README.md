## Election Audit Summary

With some small tweaking our company proposes to the election commission they can use this program for any campaign. With an additional bucket district we can take this software state wide. We would apply more for loops and conditionals to run the program on a state level. This would tell us the winning candidate for the whole state. We could also change the filters of the data to get more insight like how big the gap was between the winning candidate and the runner up.
